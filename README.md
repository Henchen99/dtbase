# DTbase

This is a small project me and a few friends worked on to aid our tutoring for GCSE/A level students, as well as learn and develop and learn how to create a website.

It is my first website, I learnt CSS and HTML through various websites and youtbe tutorials, so the coding and file organisation is a mess.

I currently am working on another project as well which is slightly more backend. Hopefully that will be done soon!
