                        <li>Designed to ensure that all products must be of a <b>satisfactory

                            retailer</li>
                        <li>The legislation applies to all products <b>including</b> those that are 
                            provided <b>digitally</b> such as download software or are web based</li>
                        <li>The legislation protects the consumer by requiring goods to be in 
                            full working order when bought, although the expected standard
