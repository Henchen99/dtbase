                        <p><b>Overview:</b></p>
                        <p>Materials are tested to evaluate their mechanical and physical properties. These tests are used in both workshop and industrial settings to measure various characteristics of materials, including their strength, toughness, hardness, malleability, corrosion resistance, and conductivity.</p>
                
                        <p><b>Common Tests and How They Work:</b></p>
                
                        <ul>
                            <ol><li><b>Tensile Strength Test:</b> Measures how much force a material can withstand before breaking or stretching. Typically conducted with a universal testing machine (UTM).</li></ol>
                            <ol><li><b>Toughness Test:</b> Assesses the material's ability to absorb energy before fracturing. Often measured by impact tests, such as the Charpy test.</li></ol>
                            <ol><li><b>Hardness Test:</b> Determines the material's resistance to indentation or scratching. Common tests include the Brinell, Rockwell, and Vickers hardness tests.</li></ol>
                            <ol><li><b>Malleability Test:</b> Evaluates how easily a material can be shaped or deformed without breaking. This is typically tested by bending or hammering a sample.</li></ol>
                            <ol><li><b>Corrosion Test:</b> Measures how materials degrade when exposed to different environmental factors such as moisture, salts, and chemicals. Can involve salt spray tests or accelerated aging tests.</li></ol>
                            <ol><li><b>Conductivity Test:</b> Measures the material's ability to conduct electricity or heat. Electrical conductivity is tested using a multimeter, and thermal conductivity is evaluated with various heat flow techniques.</li></ol>
                        </ul><br>
