                <ul>
                    <li>A feasibility study is an analysis to assess the practicality and viability of a proposed design or project before moving forward with full-scale production.</li>
                    <li>The study considers factors such as technical feasibility, financial viability, resource availability, and potential market demand.</li>
                    <li>It helps businesses identify potential risks and challenges and determine if a project should proceed, be modified, or be abandoned.</li>
                    <li>Feasibility studies typically involve assessing the technical capabilities needed for production, the cost of materials, and the potential return on investment.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <h3 id="TestingPrototypes"><b><u>Testing of Prototypes with Potential Consumers:</b></u></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Testing prototypes involves creating an early version of a product to assess its functionality, design, and user experience.</li>
                    <li>By testing prototypes with potential consumers, companies can gather valuable feedback to refine the design before mass production begins.</li>
                    <li>Prototype testing can identify design flaws, gauge user acceptance, and assess overall demand for the product.</li>
                    <li>Consumer feedback during prototype testing helps ensure that the product meets the needs and preferences of the target market.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <h3 id="StepsInFeasibilityStudy"><b><u>Steps Involved in a Feasibility Study:</b></u></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Define the Problem: Clearly outline the problem the product is trying to solve.</li>
                    <li>2. Technical Feasibility: Evaluate whether the necessary technology and skills are available to build the product.</li>
                    <li>3. Financial Feasibility: Analyse the costs of production, market research, and distribution to determine if the project is financially viable.</li>
                    <li>4. Market Feasibility: Assess the demand for the product and the target audience.</li>
                    <li>5. Risk Analysis: Identify potential risks, such as competition, market shifts, and supply chain issues.</li>
                    <li>6. Conclusion: Decide whether the product should move to the next phase of development or if adjustments are needed.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <h3 id="BenefitsOfFeasibilityStudies"><b><u>Benefits of Feasibility Studies:</b></u></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides a clear understanding of the product's potential success in the market.</li>
                    <li>Helps save time and money by identifying problems early in the development process.</li>
                    <li>Improves decision-making by providing data on technical, financial, and market considerations.</li>
                    <li>Increases the chances of successful product launch by refining designs and addressing consumer needs.</li>
