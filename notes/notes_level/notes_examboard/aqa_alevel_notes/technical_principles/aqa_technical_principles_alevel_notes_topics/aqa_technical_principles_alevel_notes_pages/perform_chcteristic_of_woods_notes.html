                    <h3 style="font-size: medium; color: blue;">Types of Timber and Manufactured Boards and Their Characteristics:</h3>

                    <ul style="font-size: medium;">
                        <li><b>Rough Sawn</b> – Timber that has been cut to size but not smoothed or finished. It retains a rough texture and is often used in structural applications or for rustic designs.</li>
                        <li><b>Planed Square Edge (PSE)</b> – Timber that has been planed on one side to create a smooth surface with a square edge, commonly used in joinery and furniture making.</li>
                        <li><b>Planed All Round (PAR)</b> – Timber that has been planed on all sides to produce a smooth, finished appearance, making it ideal for furniture and decorative work.</li>
                        <li><b>Natural Timber</b> – Timber that has not been altered beyond the initial cutting process, retaining its natural colour and grain. It’s often used for high-end furniture and aesthetic applications.</li>
                        <li><b>Manufactured Boards</b> – Engineered wood products such as plywood, MDF, and chipboard. These are created by binding wood fibres together and are often used in construction and furniture production due to their consistency and strength.</li>
                        <li><b>Mouldings</b> – Timber that has been shaped or formed into decorative profiles, commonly used for trim, frames, and finishing touches in both traditional and modern designs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    </div>

                    <h3 style="font-size: medium; color: blue;">Key Characteristics of Timber and Its Performance:</h3>

                    <ul style="font-size: medium;">
                        <li><b>Grain Pattern</b> – The arrangement of fibres in the timber, which can vary in appearance depending on the type of wood. The grain pattern affects the strength and aesthetics of the wood, with straight grain offering higher strength and uniformity.</li>
                        <li><b>Grain Direction</b> – The orientation of the wood fibres, which can impact the wood’s strength and workability. Timber is stronger along the grain and can be more difficult to cut or shape against the grain.</li>
                        <li><b>Surface Defects</b> – Imperfections such as knots, cracks, and splits that can affect the wood's strength, appearance, and suitability for certain applications. These defects may reduce the overall value of the timber.</li>
                        <li><b>Warpage</b> – The distortion or bending of timber due to changes in moisture content, temperature, or drying methods. Warped wood may be difficult to work with and may not maintain its shape in certain applications.</li>
                        <li><b>Shrinkage</b> – The reduction in size of timber as it dries out and loses moisture. Shrinkage can cause timber to change shape, which must be considered in design and construction.</li>
                        <li><b>Splitting</b> – The separation of the wood along its grain, typically caused by excessive dryness or stress. Splitting can affect the structural integrity of the wood and its appearance.</li>
                        <li><b>Joining</b> – The ability to bond timber pieces together. Different timber types have different joining properties, and choosing the right adhesive or method is essential for a strong bond.</li>
                        <li><b>Forming</b> – The process of shaping wood into specific forms using tools or machinery. Forming can involve cutting, bending, or molding the timber to meet the desired specifications.</li>
                        <li><b>Steam Bending</b> – A method of bending timber by softening it with steam, allowing it to be shaped without cracking. This is commonly used in making curved furniture and architectural components.</li>
                        <li><b>Laminating</b> – A process where multiple layers of wood are bonded together to create a stronger or more durable piece of timber. Laminated timber is often used in structural applications.</li>
                        <li><b>Machining Qualities</b> – The ability of timber to be processed using tools such as saws, drills, or routers. Different wood types have varying machining qualities based on their hardness, grain pattern, and moisture content.</li>
                        <li><b>Resistance to Decay</b> – The natural ability of timber to resist the effects of biological degradation, such as fungal or insect attacks. Some timbers are naturally resistant to decay, making them ideal for outdoor and high-moisture environments.</li>
                        <li><b>Moisture Resistance</b> – The ability of timber to withstand exposure to moisture without warping, swelling, or rotting. Moisture-resistant timbers are often used in environments subject to high humidity or rain.</li>
                        <li><b>Toxicity</b> – Some timber types, such as those treated with preservatives or naturally occurring chemicals, can be toxic to humans or animals. It's important to be aware of any risks related to toxicity, especially when using wood in construction or furniture that will be in contact with people.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><b>Hardwoods</b> tend to be <span class="custom-highlight">more expensive</span> due to the longer time to grow to maturity</li>
                        <li><b>Hardwoods</b> tend to be <span class="custom-highlight">denser</span> due to slow growth times, this makes them more durable, stronger, harder and tougher than softwoods</li>
                        <li><b>Hardwoods</b> tend to be <span class="custom-highlight">darker</span> than softwoods</li>
